import { Steps } from '@astrojs/starlight/components';

The Terrateam configuration file (`config.yml`) is the primary way to customize how Terrateam interacts with your GitHub repository and Terraform code. This file is stored in the `.terrateam` directory at the root of your repository.

:::note
The `.terrateam/config.yml` file is the source of truth for Terrateam's behavior in your repository.
:::

## Basic Structure

The `config.yml` file is written in YAML and has the following basic structure:

```yaml
access_control:
  # Access Controls
apply_requirements:
  # Apply Requirements
dirs:
  # Repository Layout Definitions
hooks:
  # Pre/Post Hooks 
workflows:
  # Custom Workflow Steps 
# Other Configuration Options
```

## Access Control

Access Control allows you to define policies for who can perform various Terrateam operations, such as planning and applying changes. You can configure access based on individual users, GitHub teams, or repository collaborator roles.

Here's an example `access_control` configuration:

```yaml
access_control:
  policies:
    - tag_query: ''
      plan: ['*']
      apply: ['team:sre']
```

This configuration allows anyone to trigger a Plan operation but restricts Apply operations to members of the `sre` team.

For more information, see the [Access Control](/configuration-reference/access-control) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Apply Requirements

Apply Requirements allows you to specify conditions that must be met before an Apply operation can be performed on an unmerged pull request. This helps ensure that changes are properly reviewed and validated before being applied.

Here's an example `apply_requirements` configuration:

```yaml
apply_requirements:
  create_pending_apply_check: true
  checks:
    - tag_query: ""
      approved:
        enabled: true
        any_of: []
        any_of_count: 2
        all_of: []
      merge_conflicts:
        enabled: true
      status_checks:
        enabled: true
        ignore_matching:
          - "ci/.*"
```

This configuration requires that the pull request has at least 2 approvals, no merge conflicts, and all status checks (except those matching `ci/.*`) have passed before an apply can be performed.

When `create_pending_apply_check` is enabled, Terrateam will create a `Terrateam Apply` GitHub status check. Combined with [GitHub Rulesets](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/configuring-branches-and-merges-in-your-repository/managing-rulesets/about-rulesets), this prevents the pull request from being merged until all Apply operations have completed.

For more information, see the [Apply Requirements](/configuration-reference/apply-requirements) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Dirs

Dirs allow you to define which [Tags](/advanced-workflows/tags), Workspaces, and [When Modified](/configuration-reference/when-modified) rules rules apply to specific directories in your repository.

Here's an example `dirs` configuration:

```yaml
dirs:
  ec2:
    tags: [aws, ec2]
    workspaces:
      production:
        tags: [production]
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: ["ec2/*.tf", "ec2/*.tfvars", "iam/*.tf", "iam/*.tfvars"]
  iam:
    tags: [aws, iam]
```

This configuration assigns the Tags `aws` and `ec2` to the `ec2` directory, and the Tags `aws` and `iam` to the `iam` directory. It also specifies that the `production` Workspace should be used when a [Tag Query](/advanced-workflows/tags) includes `aws`, `ec2`, and `production` for a [Workflow](/configuration-reference/workflows) or [Command](/command-reference). Additionally, it overrides the [`when_modified`](/configuration-reference/when-modified) file patterns for the `ec2` directory.

Terrateam also supports glob patterns in the `dirs` directive, allowing you to match multiple directories with similar configurations. The `${DIR}` variable can be used to specify the directory that Terrateam is working against, relative to the root of the repository.

For more information, see the [Dirs](/configuration-reference/dirs) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Hooks

Hooks allow you to run custom commands or set environment variables before (pre-hooks) or after (post-hooks) Terrateam operations. There are three types of Hooks:

- `all`: Executed for both Plan and Apply operations
- `plan`: Executed only for Plan operations
- `apply`: Executed only for Apply operations

Here's an example `hooks` configuration:

```yaml
hooks:
  all:
    pre:
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Running pre-hook for all operations']
  plan:
    post:
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Running post-hook for plan operations']
```

For more details, see the [Hooks](/configuration-reference/hooks) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Workflows

Workflows allow you to define custom steps for Terrateam's Plan and Apply operations. You can use Workflows to replace or augment the default behavior.

Here's an example `workflows` configuration:

```yaml
workflows:
  - tag_query: "dir:production"
    plan:
      - type: init
      - type: plan
        extra_args: ["-var-file=production.tfvars"]
    apply:
      - type: init
      - type: apply
      - type: run
        cmd: ['echo', 'Error running apply']
        run_on: failure
```

This workflow runs a custom plan and apply process for any changes in the `production` directory.

For more information, see the [Workflows](/configuration-reference/workflows) section of the Configuration Reference.

## Other Configuration Options

The `config.yml` file supports many other configuration options, including:

- `engine`: Set the IaC tool to be used for operations.
- `when_modified`: Configure when Terrateam should trigger based on file changes
- `cost_estimation`: Enable and configure cost estimation for Terraform plans
- `automerge`: Automatically merge pull requests after successful applies

For a complete list of available options and their usage, refer to the [Configuration Reference](/configuration-reference) section of the documentation.
