In some cases, you may want to prevent Terrateam from running plans or applies within certain directories of your repository. Ignoring a directory in Terrateam can be helpful for directories that contain supporting files, documentation, or other resources unrelated to Terraform infrastructure.

## How to Ignore a Directory
To ignore a directory in Terrateam, add it to the `dirs` section in your `.terrateam/config.yml` file and set `when_modified.file_patterns` to empty.

Here's an example of how to ignore the `docs` directory:

```yaml
dirs:
  docs:
    when_modified:
      file_patterns: []
```

The `docs` directory will be ignored by Terrateam, so changes to it will not trigger any plans or applies.
