## Malformed Glob

There is an error in the repository configuration with a malformed glob, either in a `dirs` specification or a `file_patterns`.  Note, if you're using using `${DIR}`, that is only valid in `dirs` entries that have a glob (`*` or `**`) in them.


The malformed glob is `@glob@`.

Characters other than `0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`, `_`, `-`, `.`, and ` ` must be escaped with with `\`.  For example, the glob `prod/@@vars/*.tf` would be written `prod/\@@vars/*.tf`.
