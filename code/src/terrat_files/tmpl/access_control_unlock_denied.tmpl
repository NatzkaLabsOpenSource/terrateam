## Access Control :no_entry:

The user `@user@` does not have permission to perform an `unlock`.

The `unlock` operation requires a user matching at least one of the following entries:

@#match_list-@
- `@item@`
@/match_list-@

The access control configuration is taken from the Terrateam configuration is the `@default_branch@` branch.

See the [documentation](https://docs.terrateam.io/configuration/access-control) for how to configure access control.
