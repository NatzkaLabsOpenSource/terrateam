<h2>v1.0.0 - effective October 6th, 2021</h2>
<h3>Who We Are and What This Policy Covers</h3>
<p>This Privacy Policy applies to information collected by Abiogenesis Computer Systems Lab AB d/b/a Terrateam (hereinafter &ldquo;Terrateam&rdquo;) when any party uses the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>Our websites (including <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.terrateam.io/</a>);</li>
<li>Our other Terrateam products, services, and features that are available on or through our websites</li>
</ul>
<h3>Information We Collect</h3>
<p>We only collect information about you if we have a reason to do so - for example, to provide our Services, to communicate with you, or to make our Services better. We collect information primarily from three sources: if and when you provide information to us, automatically through operating our Services, and from outside sources.</p>
<p><strong>Information You Provide to Us</strong></p>
<p>We collect information that you provide to us directly. Here are some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Basic account information:</strong> We ask for basic information from you in order to set up your account. For example, we require individuals who sign up for a Terrateam.io account to provide an email address and password, along with a username or name. We reserve the right to request additional information that Terrateam deems necessary to administer your account.&nbsp;</li>
<li><strong>Payment and contact information:</strong> If you buy something from us, we'll collect information to process those payments and contact you including, but not limited to:&nbsp; your name, credit card information, and contact information. We also keep a record of the purchases you've made. All personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Communications with us:</strong> You may also provide us with information when you respond to surveys, communicate with our staff about a support question, or sign up for a newsletter. When you communicate with us via form, email, phone, or otherwise, we store a copy of our communications (including any call recordings as permitted by applicable law).</li>
</ul>
<h4>Information We Collect Automatically</h4>
<p>We also collect some information automatically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Log information:</strong> Like most online service providers, we collect information that web browsers, mobile devices, and servers typically make available, including the browser type, IP address, unique device identifiers, language preference, referring site, the date and time of access, operating system, and mobile network information. We collect log information when you use our Services.</li>
<li><strong>Information from cookies &amp; other technologies:</strong> A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor's computer, and that the visitor's browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. Pixel tags (also called web beacons) are small blocks of code placed on websites and emails. Terrateam uses cookies and other technologies like pixel tags to help us identify and track visitors, usage, and access preferences for our Services, as well as track and understand email campaign effectiveness and to deliver targeted ads. For more information about our use of cookies and other technologies for tracking, including how you can control the use of cookies, please see our <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h3>How and Why We Use Information</h3>
<h4>Purposes for Using Information</h4>
<p>We use information about you for the purposes listed below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>To provide our Services.</strong> For example, to set up and maintain your account, provide customer service, process payments and orders, and verify user information.</li>
<li><strong>To market our Services and measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our marketing.</strong> For example, by targeting our marketing messages to groups of our users (like those who have a particular plan with us or have been users for a certain length of time), advertising our Services, analyzing the results of our marketing campaigns (like how many people purchased a paid plan after receiving a marketing message), and understanding and forecasting user retention.</li>
<li><strong>To fix problems with our Services.</strong> For example, by monitoring, debugging, repairing, and preventing issues.</li>
<li><strong>To customize the user experience.</strong> For example, to personalize your experience by serving you relevant notifications and advertisements for our Services.</li>
<li><strong>To communicate with you.</strong> For example, by emailing you to ask for your feedback, share tips for getting the most out of our products, or keep you up to date on Terrateam. If you don't want to hear from us, you can opt out of marketing communications at any time. (If you opt out, we'll still send you important updates relating to your account.)</li>
<li><strong>For other business purposes.</strong> We may use your information for other business purposes, such as data analysis, identifying usage trends, determining the effectiveness of our promotional campaigns and to evaluate and improve our Services, products, marketing and your experience. We may use and store this information in aggregated and anonymized form so that it is not associated with individual end users and does not include personal information. We will not use identifiable personal information without your consent.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Legal Bases for Collecting and Using Information</h4>
<p>A note here for those in the European Union about our legal grounds for processing information about you under EU data protection laws, which is that our use of your information is based on the grounds that: (1) The use is necessary in order to fulfill our commitments to you under the applicable terms of service or other agreements with you or is necessary to administer your account - for example, in order to enable access to our website on your device or charge you for a paid plan; or (2) The use is necessary for compliance with a legal obligation; or (3) The use is necessary in order to protect your vital interests or those of another person; or (4) We have a legitimate interest in using your information - for example, to provide and update our Services; to improve our Services so that we can offer you an even better user experience; to safeguard our Services; to communicate with you; to measure, gauge, and improve the effectiveness of our advertising; and to understand our user retention and attrition; to monitor and prevent any problems with our Services; and to personalize your experience; or (5) You have given us your consent - for example before we place certain cookies on your device and access and analyze them later on, as described in our <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>.</p>
<h3>Sharing Information</h3>
<h4>How We Share Information</h4>
<p>We share information about you in limited circumstances, and with appropriate safeguards on your privacy.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Subsidiaries and independent contractors:</strong> We may disclose information about you to our subsidiaries and independent contractors who need the information to help us provide our Services or process the information on our behalf. We require our subsidiaries and independent contractors to follow this Privacy Policy for any personal information that we share with them.</li>
<li><strong>Third-party vendors:</strong> We may share information about you with third-party vendors who need the information in order to provide their services to us, or to provide their services to you or your site. This includes vendors that help us provide our Services to you (like Stripe, payment providers that process your credit and debit card information, fraud prevention services that allow us to analyze fraudulent payment transactions, cloud storage services, postal and email delivery services that help us stay in touch with you, customer chat and email support services that help us communicate with you; those that assist us with our marketing efforts (e.g., by providing tools for identifying a specific marketing target group or improving our marketing campaigns, and by placing ads to market our services); those that help us understand and enhance our Services (like analytics providers); those that make tools to help us run our operations (like programs that help us with task management, scheduling, word processing, email and other communications, and collaboration among our teams); other third-party tools that help us manage operations; and companies that make products available on our websites, who may need information about you in order to, for example, provide technical or other support services to you. We require vendors to agree to privacy commitments in order to share information with them. Other vendors are listed in our more specific policies (e.g., our <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/cookies" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Cookie Policy</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Legal and regulatory requirements:</strong> We may disclose information about you in response to a subpoena, court order, or other governmental request.</li>
<li><strong>To protect rights, property, and others:</strong> We may disclose information about you when we believe in good faith that disclosure is reasonably necessary to protect the property or rights of Terrateam, third parties, or the public at large.</li>
<li><strong>Business transfers:</strong> In connection with any merger, sale of company assets, or acquisition of all or a portion of our business by another company, or in the unlikely event that Terrateam goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would likely be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. If any of these events were to happen, this Privacy Policy would continue to apply to your information and the party receiving your information may continue to use your information, but only consistent with this Privacy Policy.</li>
<li><strong>With your consent:</strong> We may share and disclose information with your consent or at your direction. For example, we may share your information with third parties when you authorize us to do so.</li>
<li><strong>Aggregated or de-identified information:</strong> We may share information that has been aggregated or de-identified, so that it can no longer reasonably be used to identify you. For instance, we may publish aggregate statistics about the use of our Services, or share a hashed version of your email address to facilitate customized ad campaigns on other platforms.</li>
<li><strong>Published support requests:</strong> If you send us a request for assistance (for example, via a support email or one of our other feedback mechanisms), we reserve the right to publish that request in order to clarify or respond to your request, or to help us support other users.</li>
</ul>
<p>We have a long-standing policy that we do not sell our users' data. We aren't a data broker, we don't sell your personal information to data brokers, and we don't sell your information to other companies that want to spam you with marketing emails.</p>
<h3>How Long We Keep Information</h3>
<p>We generally discard information about you when it's no longer needed for the purposes for which we collect and use it. There is more information described in the section above on How and Why We Use Information.</p>
<h3>Security</h3>
<p>While no online service is 100% secure, we work very hard to protect information about you against unauthorized access, use, alteration, or destruction, and take reasonable measures to do so. We monitor our Services for potential vulnerabilities and attacks.</p>
<h3>Choices</h3>
<p>You have several choices available when it comes to information about you:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Limit the information that you provide:</strong> If you have an account with us, you can choose not to provide the optional account information, profile information, and transaction and billing information. Please keep in mind that if you do not provide this information, certain features of our Services may not be accessible.</li>
<li><strong>Opt out of marketing communications:</strong> You may opt out of receiving promotional communications from us. Just follow the instructions in those communications or let us know. If you opt out of promotional communications, we may still send you other communications, like those about your account and legal notices.</li>
<li><strong>Set your browser to reject cookies</strong></li>
<li><strong>Close your account</strong></li>
</ul>
<h3>Your Rights</h3>
<p>If you are located in certain parts of the world, including California and countries that fall under the scope of the European General Data Protection Regulation (aka the "GDPR"), you may have certain rights regarding your personal information, like the right to request access to or deletion of your data.</p>
<h4>European General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</h4>
<p>If you are located in a country that falls under the scope of the GDPR, data protection laws give you certain rights with respect to your personal data, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the rights to:</p>

<h4>California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</h4>
<p>The California Consumer Privacy Act ("CCPA") requires us to provide California residents with some additional information about the categories of personal information we collect and share, where we get that personal information, and how and why we use it. The CCPA also requires us to provide a list of the "categories" of personal information we collect, as that term is defined in the law, so, here it is. In the last 12 months, we collected the following categories of personal information from California residents, depending on the Services used:</p>
<ul>
<li>Identifiers (like your name, contact information, and device and online identifiers);</li>
<li>Commercial information (your billing information and purchase history, for example);</li>
<li>Characteristics protected by law (for example, you might provide your gender as part of a research survey for us);</li>
<li>Internet or other electronic network activity information (such as your usage of our Services);</li>
<li>Geolocation data (such as your location based on your IP address);</li>
<li>Audio, electronic, visual or similar information (such as your profile picture, if you uploaded one);</li>
<li>Professional or employment-related information (for example, your company and team information); and</li>
<li>Inferences we make (such as likelihood of retention or attrition).</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find more information about what we collect and sources of that information in the Information We Collect section above. We collect personal information for the business and commercial purposes described in the How and Why We Use Information section. And we share this information with the categories of third parties described in the Sharing Information section. If you are a California resident, you have additional rights under the CCPA, subject to any exemptions provided by the law, including the right to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Request to know the categories of personal information we collect, the categories of business or commercial purpose for collecting and using it, the categories of sources from which the information came, the categories of third parties we share it with, and the specific pieces of information we collect about you;</li>
<li>Request deletion of personal information we collect or maintain;</li>
<li>Opt out of any sale of personal information; and</li>
<li>Not receive discriminatory treatment for exercising your rights under the CCPA.</li>

<h3>Other Things You Should Know</h3>
<h4>Transferring Information</h4>
<p>Because Terrateam's Services are offered worldwide, the information about you that we process when you use the Services in the EU may be used, stored, and/or accessed by individuals operating outside the European Economic Area (EEA) who work for us, other members of our group of companies, or third-party data processors. This is required for the purposes listed in the How and Why We Use Information section above. When providing information about you to entities outside the EEA, we will take appropriate measures to ensure that the recipient protects your personal information adequately in accordance with this Privacy Policy as required by applicable law. These measures include entering into European Commission approved standard contractual arrangements with entities based in countries outside the EEA. You can ask us for more information about the steps we take to protect your personal information when transferring it from the EU.</p>
<h3>Privacy Policy Changes</h3>
<p>Although most changes are likely to be minor, Terrateam may change its Privacy Policy from time to time. Terrateam encourages visitors to frequently check this page for any changes to its Privacy Policy. If we make changes, we will notify you by email. Your further use of the Services after a change to our Privacy Policy will be subject to the updated policy.</p>
