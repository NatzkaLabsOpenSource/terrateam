If you use our Services on behalf of another person or entity, you represent and warrant that you're authorized to accept the Agreement on that person's or entity's behalf, that by using using our Services you're accepting the Agreement on behalf of that person or entity, and that if you, or that person or entity, violates the Agreement, you and that person or entity agree to be responsible to us.

<h2>2. User Account</h2>
<p>In the event that the use of the Services requires the creation of a user account, the user agrees to provide Terrateam with complete and accurate information. The user agrees to maintain accurate contact information so that Terrateam can communicate with the user about the user account for the purposes including, but not limited to: (1) updates to the Agreement; (2) responding to user complaints; and (3) any other purpose relevant to the user account. Terrateam reserves the right to limit user access to the Services until Terrateam can verify relevant account information such as e-mail addresses. User agrees that the creation of a Terrateam.io account is an inquiry into the Services and agrees to be contacted about additional Services offered by Terrateam. User retains the right to opt out of any and all marketing communications. If you'd like to learn about how we handle the data you provide us, please see our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p>User is solely responsible and liable for all activity conducted via the user's Terrateam account. User is responsible for maintaining the security of the user's own account including creating a secure password and keeping said password private. User agrees not to share or misuse access credentials relating to the Services. User must immediately notify Terrateam of any unauthorized uses of the Services or any other breach of the Agreement. If Terrateam reasonably believes that a user account has been compromised, Terrateam reserves the right to suspend or disable the user account.</p>
<p>Terrateam waives all liability for any acts or omissions by the user that result in adverse consequences for the user including any damages that may result from the act or omission. For example, if user is terminated from user's place of employment for writing a negative blog post about user's boss via one of Terrateam's services, Terrateam is not responsible for said termination.</p>
<h2>3. Minimum Age Requirements</h2>
<p>The Services are not intended for children. Users are not allowed to access or use the Services if the user is under 13 years of age (or 16 years of age in Europe). By registering an account, users are representing that they meet the minimum age requirements outlined above. Users may only use the Services if the user can legally form a binding contract with us. In other words, if a user is under 18 years of age (or the legal age of majority where the user lives), the user can only use the Services under the supervision of a parent or legal guardian. The parent or legal guardian is subject to all of the terms in the Agreement.</p>

Terrateam is not responsible for any use or effects of Content or third-party websites. Terrateam waives any liability arising from the above-referenced third-party interactions and further states that:</p>
<ul>

<li>Terrateam does not control content from third-party websites. Terrateam isn't responsible for any harm resulting from anyone's access, use, purchase, or downloading of Content, or for any harm resulting from third-party websites.

</ul>
<p>Please note that additional third-party terms and conditions may apply to Content users download, copy, purchase, or use.</p>
<h2>5. Fees, Payment, and Renewal</h2>
<p><strong>Fees for Paid Services.</strong> Some of the Services are offered for a fee, like <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/pricing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Terrateam.io plans</a> (collectively, "Paid Services"). By using a Paid Service, user agrees to pay the specified fees. Depending on the Paid Service, there may be one-time fees or recurring fees. For recurring fees, Terrateam will bill or charge you in the automatically-renewing interval (such as monthly, annually, or biennially) selected by the user, on a pre-pay basis until the user cancels, which you can do at any time by contacting the relevant support team.</p>
<p><strong>Taxes.</strong> To the extent permitted by law, or unless explicitly stated otherwise, fees do not include applicable federal, provincial, state, local or other governmental sales, value-added, goods and services, harmonized or other taxes, fees, or charges ("Taxes"). User is responsible for paying all applicable Taxes relating to&nbsp; use of the Services, payments, or purchases. If Terrateam is obligated to pay or collect Taxes on the fees user paid or will pay, user is responsible for those Taxes, and Terrateam may collect payment.</p>
<p><strong>Payment.</strong> If user payment fails, or the Paid Services are otherwise not paid on time), or Terrateam reasonably suspects a payment is fraudulent, Terrateam reserves the right to immediately cancel or revoke user access to Paid Services without notice to user.</p>
<p><strong>Automatic Renewal.</strong> To ensure uninterrupted service, recurring Paid Services are automatically renewed. This means that unless a user cancels a Paid Service before the end of the applicable subscription period, the Paid Service will automatically renew, and user authorizes Terrateam to use any payment mechanism Terrateam has on record for said user or invoice the user (in which case payment is due within 15 days) to collect the then-applicable subscription fee as well as any Taxes. By default,&nbsp; Paid Services will be renewed for the same interval as your original subscription period. Terrateam may charge a user account up to one month before the end of the subscription period to make sure billing issues don't inadvertently disrupt user access to the Services. The date for the automatic renewal is based on the date of the original purchase and cannot be changed. If a user purchased access to multiple services, that user may have multiple renewal dates. Users can view renewal date(s) and manage subscriptions for Terrateam.io Paid Services by logging into <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.terrateam.io/</a>. Users will be notified by email before Paid Services renew.</p>
<p><strong>Cancelling Automatic Renewal.</strong> Users can manage and cancel Paid Services through <a href="https://www.terrateam.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.terrateam.io/</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Fees and Changes.</strong> Terrateam may change fees at any time in accordance with these Terms and requirements under applicable law. This includes, but is not limited to, changing fees for standard services, implementation of fees for services that were previously free, and removing features or functionality that were previously included in the fees. If a user doesn&rsquo;t agree with the changes, that user may cancel the Paid Service.</p>
<p><strong>Refunds.</strong> There are no refunds and all payments are final.</p>
